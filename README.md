# Bug Bounty
This is a pilot program set up to encourage more players to report bugs. Every bug reported and resolved will be rewarded with a bounty.

This repository is currently set up for the sole purpose of reporting bugs only. However, we may decide to expand to allow feature enhancements and suggestions in the future.

### Critical Security Exploits or Bugs
DO NOT post such issues with great detail on this platform. Create an issue in high level detail containing little to no exposure of the bug and write an email to `myst@titan.tf` or [open a support ticket](https://titan.tf/support) with the full details including the steps to replicate it.


## Rewards
The bug classification is on a case by case basis.

### Fix Titan.TF
We do not intend for this to fully replace the [Fix Titan.TF](https://fix.titan.tf) platform at this time. It currently only serves as another channel to report bugs to. However, if you want to be rewarded with the bug bounty, the bug must be reported here.
